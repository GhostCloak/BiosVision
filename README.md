- Version   : 1.4

Vision is a clean, modern blog theme designed to put the focus on both your content and identity. It features a large sidebar photo to showcase your identity and then gets out of the way.

This is of course a theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

## Changelog

- 1.4 - Change license from CC-BY-SA to MIT
- 1.3 - Replaced Mono Social Icons Font with Font Awesome
- 1.2 - Updated to Bootstrap 3.0.1
- 1.1 - Disqus Fix
- 1.0 - Initial Release

## Getting Started

- About & Contact Pages: Ghost does not yet offer official support for pages however you can add a post and set the post date in the past to 'hide' it. Then you can simply add the links to your sidebar in the `BiosVision/partials/sidebar.hbs` file.
- Author Profile: You will want to fill this in along with a photo as it is displayed in the footer of each post. 100x100 works well for the photo.
- Disqus Comments: You will need to input your `disqus_shortname` and `disqus_url` to enable disqus. If you wish to disable it, simply remove the `<section class="comments">` tags & everything between.
- Photo: The sidebar photo is set by changing your blog logo. The example image is 360x538 however you can use different sizes if needed.
- Social Links: You can edit these by modifying the `BiosVision/partials/sidebar.hbs` file. There are also other icons in the [Mono Social Icons Font](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/) you can use.

Important Note: You typically will have to restart Ghost to see theme changes take effect.
