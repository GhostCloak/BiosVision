<ul>
<li>Disqus Comment Integration with manual loading for faster pages</li>
<li>Fully Responsive Embedded Videos (YouTube, Vimeo, Kickstarter)
Social Network links to connect with your readers  </li>
<li>Based on Bootstrap to provide a clean, easy to modify framework</li>

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>

<p>I will be updating this theme as-needed for as long as possible and will provide general support on getting it setup. I'm unable to guarantee 'lifetime' support or anything of the sort currently however I'll do the best I can. I don't believe in promising what you can't deliver.</p>

<h2 id="futureplans">Future Plans</h2>

<p>Assuming there is interest, I'm thinking of continuing to add features such as tabular sidebar content, image gallery support (eg. smugmug, g+, facebook) and several more useful features.</p>

<p>"Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler" - Albert Einstein</p>

<h2 id="whyghost">Why Ghost?</h2>

<p>Ghost is a great new publishing platform that offers a simple, much-improved system for writing online. Rather than repeat them, I'll let the features do the talking. - <a href="https://ghost.org/features/">https://ghost.org/features/</a></p>

<p>I think it's a great project and so My efforts are going towards making Ghost a viable platform by building the community and services to support it.</p>

<h2 id="whyusepaywhatyouwant">Why use pay-what-you-want?</h2>

<p>It's something of an experiment. I'm an open-source kinda guy and I don't really like restricting who can access it, but I still need to eat. If you like this theme and want me to continue work on it and similar projects, please chip in whatever you think it's worth.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You're live!

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href="http://ghost.org">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ghost - Just a blogging platform</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
